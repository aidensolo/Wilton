	<h3>hello, my name is wilton lai. In the past I always had the passion to build and create my dreams. but just coudn't find the link. FINALLY after months i finally found the key to my hopes and realised that only a thin layer of discouragement stopped me from achieving what i always wanted. it was 2017 and we took a trip to HOKIDO. as we explored the area we saw many beautiful buildings from being just a stumpy and cool looking building to skyscrapers breaking the limits we coudn't before. it was at that moment that i realised that what i would like to achieve was just inches from my grasp. i discovered architecture. </h3>
	<h2>intrests</h2>
	<h3>ofcourse i didn't just like architecture, i also liked playing basketball for HOURS. And i still do today. most people who play basketball at first get frustrated and angry because it is not as easy as you think, for example you have to try think of different angles where you can take your opponents for suprise or just score easier. which is like real life in many ways, instead of taking a problem head on you can find different solutions to the problem.</h3>
